;;; Commentary:

;;; Do you often yank source code into your org files, manually
;;; surrounding it in #+BEGIN_SRC blocks? This package will give you a
;;; new way of pasting that automatically surrounds the snippet in
;;; blocks, marked with the language of the major mode of where the
;;; code came from, and adds a link to the source file after the
;;; block.

;;; To use, require and bind whatever keys you prefer to the
;;; interactive functions:
;;;
;;; (require 'org-rich-yank)
;;; (eval-after-load 'org
;;;   '(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-y") #'org-rich-yank)))
;;;

;;; If you prefer `use-package', the above settings would be:
;;;
;;; (use-package org-rich-yank
;;;   :ensure t
;;;   :config
;;;   (eval-after-load 'org
;;;     '(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-y") #'org-rich-yank)))
;;;
;;; Note that we eagerly load `org-rich-yank', so we can capture yanks
;;; that happen before `org' is loaded.
